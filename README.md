# Cluster_Analysis
Business Objective: Creating clusters on global development measurement dataset...
Global Development Measurement Dataset Clustering Project
This repository contains code and resources for performing clustering analysis on a dataset comprising important economic and development metrics of countries worldwide.

Business Objective
The primary goal of this project is to cluster countries based on various economic and development indicators present in the dataset. This clustering will help in identifying patterns and similarities among countries concerning these metrics.

Dataset Details
The dataset used for this project contains information on several key variables for various countries. Some of the variables included are:

Birth Rate
Business Tax
CO2 Emissions
Country
Days to Start Business
Ease of Business
Energy Usage
GDP
Health Expenditure as a percentage of GDP
Health Expenditure per Capita
Hours to Do Tax
Infant Mortality
Internet Usage
Lending Rate
Life Expectancy (Female)
...and more
Acceptance Criterion
The project follows these criteria:

Utilizing different clustering models (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, etc.) for analysis.
Conducting a comparative analysis of the clustering models to evaluate their performance.
Deployment of the clustering application using frameworks like Streamlit, Flask, etc., enabling interactive exploration of clustered data.
Files and Folders
data/: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data exploration, preprocessing, and clustering analysis.
src/: Source code for the clustering application.
requirements.txt: Lists the necessary dependencies to run the application.
Usage
To run the clustering application:

Ensure you have Python installed.
Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Navigate to the src/ directory.
Run the main application file.
Example:

bash
Copy code
cd src/
python app.py
